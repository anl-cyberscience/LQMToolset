# Last Quarter Mile Toolset

The Last Quarter Mile Toolset (`LQMT`) is used to automate action to endpoint defense tools using data from Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). 

### Overview

`LQMT` works by taking CTI data and breaking it down into a common data format. Specialized tools designed to interface with endpoint defense tools  take this common data format and communicate the parsed CTI data to the endpoint tools. `LQMT` is able to string these tools together in a group called ToolChains, so you can automate actions to a variety of different tools all at once. 

Text-based diagram of how CTI Data flows to a chain of tools using LQMT: 

                        ---> Firewall
                       /
    CTI Data ---> LQMT ----> SIEM
                       \
                        ---> Syslog
